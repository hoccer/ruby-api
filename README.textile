h2. Usage

bc..
# Create new LinccerClient instance
client = LinccerClient.new

# Update client environment
client.update_environment(
  :gps => {:longitude => 12.2, :latitude => 14.2, :accuracy => 23.0}
)

# Share data
# The share method expects a mode and an arbitrary ruby hash which will
# be transformed to JSON and used as the payload.
c.share( "one-to-one", :foo => "bar" )

# Receive data
# The receive method expects a mode parameter and returns a ruby hash
# containing the payload
c.receive( "one-to-one" )

p. The share and receive method have threaded counterparts allowing to perform
both actions non blocking on the same ruby process.
